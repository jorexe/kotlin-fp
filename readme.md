# Functional Programming Introduction

Welcome to the Functional Programming Introduction for Beginners! This is an introduction to functional programming
concepts, with beginners in mind. While I'm not an expert in the topic, I've created a set of exercises and
explanations to help you grasp the core concepts. But keep in mind you should go deeper in the topics. 📖

🏎️/🚴 This repository is designed for you to learn at your own pace . Don't rush; take the time you need to
absorb each concept before moving on. And complement the information if you need to.

Remember, we're all here to learn and grow together. Your contributions, no matter how big or small, are valued. 💡

Happy coding! 🚀
