# Functional Programming Introduction

## Description

Welcome to the Functional Programming Introduction for Beginners! 𝐟 🫶 This is an introduction to functional programming
concepts, with beginners in mind 🧑‍🎓. While I'm not an expert in the topic, I've created a set of exercises 🏋️ and
explanations to help you grasp the core concepts. But keep in mind you should go deeper in the topics. 📖

This repository is designed for you to learn at your own pace 🏎️/🚴. Don't rush, take the time you need to
absorb each concept before moving on 🧐. And complement the information if you need to.

Remember, we're all here to learn and grow together. Your contributions, no matter how big or small, are valued. 💡

Happy coding! 🚀

## Working with the project

### Local / Online

#### Local

You can clone the project and open it with your favourite IDE. It contains also test run configurations for IntelliJ.
Of course tests will fail until you complete each exercise 😄

#### Online

You can also open this project online with [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) using the next button:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jorexe/kotlin-fp)

First time will take a while, but then you will be able to work and run your tests online.

### Running

You should run the tests to validate your work. For that you can use the script with the number of exercise

```bash
./test.sh $n

./test.sh 1 # Will run tests for exercise 1
```

Or just:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

To run all tests
